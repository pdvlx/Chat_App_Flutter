# Chat_App_Flutter
A basic public lobby chat app with private conversation feature. 

For using the app you have to create your firebase database for iOs and/or android and then follow the instructions for 
adding the google-services files into the project. 

When you done with the firebase setup, you should see the Welcome screen of the app!

And then if the user login or register, app redirected all the users into public chat lobby.

User can longpress to messagebubbles and send friend request to others in the public chat lobby and can create a private session with them if the other user accept the
friend request.

All of the UIs is not finished and if project looking like i didn't(by the time you saw the repo) you should update it. MessageBubble class and Friendlist widgets is 
seperated from hierarchy so you can easily update the majority of the UI just by changing these.


Of course credits to @AngelaYu for the amazing flutter course.
